  - "  - Action: Call the `think` tool. Your documented thought process MUST include:"
  - "    a. Acknowledging the overall goal: 'Resolve unique identities from provided GitHub and JIRA data.'"
  - "    b. Reviewing and acknowledging any input 'strategy_notes' from the 'AggregatedData'."
  - "    c. Planning your detailed approach for Step 1 (Data Preparation & Normalization): Specify how you will iterate through GitHub and JIRA records from 'sql_results'. Detail which specific sub-fields you will prioritize for extraction from common JSON columns (e.g., 'login', 'email', 'name', 'id', 'accountId' from 'AUTHOR', 'USER', 'FIELDS', etc.). Outline your strategy for scanning text fields (like PR/issue bodies, commit messages, comments) to identify potential cross-platform references (e.g., JIRA IDs like 'PROJ-123' in GitHub text, or GitHub PR/issue URLs/#numbers in JIRA text) and how you will temporarily associate these findings with the user touchpoints from which they originated."

If a link is found (e.g., JIRA ID 'PROJ-123' found in the body of a GitHub PR authored by 'gh_user_A'), create an internal note associating this link ('JIRA:PROJ-123') with the key identifiers of the user touchpoint from this record (e.g., 'gh_user_A', GitHub ID '12345').
