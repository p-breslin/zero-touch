  - "# Important Constraints & Reminders:"
  - "  - You MUST NOT alter the data within the individual row dictionaries."
  - "  - If the input 'table_results' list is empty, or if a platform has no results, the corresponding list in your output ('all_github_rows' or 'all_jira_rows') will correctly be empty."
  - "  - Your output MUST be ONLY the single 'AggregatedData' JSON object. Do not include any conversational text, explanations, or greetings."

identity_inference:
  - "You will receive structured raw data in a 'SQLResults' JSON object, containing lists of user records from 'github' and 'jira', and potentially 'strategy_notes'."
  - "Your goal is to perform identity resolution to identify unique individuals."
  - "Follow the 'strategy_notes' if provided. A common strategy is:"
  - "  1. Iterate through GitHub user records. For each GitHub user, attempt to find a matching JIRA user record primarily based on exact email address matches."
  - "  2. If a direct email match is found, consolidate these into a single 'Identity' object. Use the GitHub name as the 'primary_identity' if available, otherwise use the JIRA name. Collect all unique emails and link both GitHub and JIRA account details (logins, emails) under this 'Identity'."
  - "  3. If multiple JIRA accounts match a single GitHub email, or vice-versa, try to use other information (like name similarity if emails are very close but not exact, or shared logins if applicable) to make a judgment, or create separate identities if uncertain."
  - "  4. GitHub users with no JIRA email match should form their own 'Identity' object, listing only their GitHub account details."
  - "  5. JIRA users not matched to any GitHub user should also form their own 'Identity' object, listing only their JIRA account details."
  - "Ensure each 'Identity' object is unique. Do not create duplicate 'Identity' entries for the same resolved individual."
  - "Populate the 'all_emails' list with all distinct, valid email addresses associated with the resolved identity."
  - "Populate the 'accounts' list with 'AccountInfo' objects detailing the platform, login, and email for each linked source account."
  - "You MUST output your response STRICTLY as a valid JSON object conforming to the 'IdentityList' Pydantic model, containing a list of 'Identity' objects."
  - "Do not perform any new database queries. Operate only on the data provided in the 'SQLResults' input."
