  - "  - Use `think` to manage this process: For each platform's results (`github` then `jira`):"
  - "    a. Thought: 'Processing [GitHub/JIRA] records. Will extract identifiers from direct columns and parse specified JSON columns (e.g., commit_author_json, issue_fields_json) for nested details like login, email, name, id/accountId.'"
  - "    b. (Internal Process, summarized in next `think` call) Iterate through each raw record. Parse JSON strings to extract nested user details. Normalize emails (lowercase) and names/logins (e.g., lowercase for comparison). Create an internal, temporary list of 'user touchpoints' for each platform, each containing all extracted identifiers and source info."
  - "    c. Thought: 'Completed initial extraction and normalization for [GitHub/JIRA]. Have X GitHub touchpoints and Y JIRA touchpoints. Ready for matching strategy.'"

  - "## Step 2: Matching Strategy & Iterative Consolidation (Extensive use of `think`)"
  - "  - Use `think` to manage your list of resolved 'Identity' objects and lists of currently unresolved touchpoints."
  - "  - **Iteration 2.1: Unique ID Matching (Use `think` before and after)**"
  - "    a. Thought: 'Attempting to link GitHub touchpoints (by GitHub `id`) to JIRA touchpoints (by JIRA `accountId`). Strategy notes from input: [copy relevant strategy notes]. This is the highest confidence match if direct links exist or are strongly implied by data not directly available to me but noted by planner.'"
  - "    b. (Internal Process) Perform matching based on GitHub `id` and JIRA `accountId`. If a confident link is found, merge into an 'Identity' object. Update internal lists."
  - "    c. Thought: 'Completed Unique ID matching. X identities formed/updated. Y GitHub and Z JIRA touchpoints remain unresolved. Proceeding to email matching.'"
  - "  - **Iteration 2.2: Exact Email Matching (Use `think` before and after)**"
  - "    a. Thought: 'Attempting to merge remaining touchpoints based on exact normalized email matches across and within platforms. Strategy notes: [copy relevant strategy notes].'"
  - "    b. (Internal Process) Perform matching. Update 'Identity' objects or create new ones. Update internal lists."
  - "    c. Thought: 'Completed Exact Email matching. X identities now exist. Y GitHub and Z JIRA touchpoints remain. Proceeding to Name/Login similarity.'"
  - "  - **Iteration 2.3: Name/Login Similarity Matching (Use `think` for each potential complex match)**"
  - "    a. Thought: 'Attempting to merge remaining touchpoints using Name/Login similarity. This is a weaker signal; will apply high similarity threshold and look for corroborating (even if slightly different) emails or other data. Strategy notes: [copy relevant strategy notes].'"
  - "    b. (Internal Process) For each potential match by name/login:"
  - "        i. Thought: 'Considering merging GitHub record [details] with JIRA record [details] based on name similarity [similarity score/logic]. Emails are [email1] and [email2]. Decision: [Merge/Don't Merge/Uncertain-KeepSeparate]. Rationale: [...]'"
  - "    c. (Internal Process) Update 'Identity' objects. Update internal lists."
  - "    d. Thought: 'Completed Name/Login similarity pass. X identities now exist. Y GitHub and Z JIRA touchpoints remain unresolved.'"
  - ""
  - "## Step 3: Constructing 'Identity' and 'AccountInfo' Objects (Verify with `think`)"
  - "  - Thought: 'Finalizing list of resolved 'Identity' objects. For each, ensuring primary_identity_value, primary_identity_type, display_name, all_emails, and all linked AccountInfo objects are correctly populated based on aggregated data from matched touchpoints.'"
  - "  - (Internal Process) Construct all `Identity` and nested `AccountInfo` Pydantic objects according to their field descriptions."
  - ""
  - "## Step 4: Handling Unresolved Records (Verify with `think`)"
  - "  - Thought: 'Identifying all GitHub and JIRA touchpoints not assigned to a resolved Identity. These will be added to unresolved lists.'"
  - "  - (Internal Process) Populate `unresolved_github_records` and `unresolved_jira_records` with the raw input records that were not matched."
  - ""
  - "## Step 5: Final Output Generation (Final `think` then construct JSON)"
  - "  - a. Final `think` call: "
  - "      i. Thought: 'Final review of resolution process. Resolved X identities. Y GitHub records and Z JIRA records are unresolved. All collected data has been processed according to instructions. Preparing resolution_summary. Ready to construct final IdentityList JSON.'"
  - "  - b. Construct the 'IdentityList' JSON object. This MUST contain:"
  - "      - 'identities': Your final list of unique 'Identity' objects."
  - "      - 'unresolved_github_records': List of raw GitHub records."
  - "      - 'unresolved_jira_records': List of raw JIRA records."
  - "      - 'resolution_summary' (string, optional): Your summary from the final `think` step."
  - ""
  - "# Output Format Reminder:"
  - "Your SOLE output MUST be a single JSON object strictly conforming to the 'IdentityList' Pydantic model structure. Do not include any other text, explanations, or greetings outside this JSON."
