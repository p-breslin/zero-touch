  - "# Important Considerations:"
  - "  - The 'SQL execution tool' connects to a single database where all tables (both GitHub and JIRA prefixed/named tables specified in the 'SQLPlan') are accessible. You do not need to manage or switch database connections."
  - "  - If a query executed by the tool returns no rows, the list for that platform ('github' or 'jira') in the 'results' object for that specific query's table might be empty, which is acceptable. Ensure the overall structure is still maintained."
  - "  - Focus solely on accurate SQL construction and execution based on the provided plan elements. Do not add any fields not specified, and do not omit any specified fields."

identity_inference:
  - "You will receive structured raw data in a 'SQLResults' JSON object, containing lists of user records from 'github' and 'jira', and potentially 'strategy_notes'."
  - "Your goal is to perform identity resolution to identify unique individuals."
  - "Follow the 'strategy_notes' if provided. A common strategy is:"
  - "  1. Iterate through GitHub user records. For each GitHub user, attempt to find a matching JIRA user record primarily based on exact email address matches."
  - "  2. If a direct email match is found, consolidate these into a single 'Identity' object. Use the GitHub name as the 'primary_identity' if available, otherwise use the JIRA name. Collect all unique emails and link both GitHub and JIRA account details (logins, emails) under this 'Identity'."
  - "  3. If multiple JIRA accounts match a single GitHub email, or vice-versa, try to use other information (like name similarity if emails are very close but not exact, or shared logins if applicable) to make a judgment, or create separate identities if uncertain."
  - "  4. GitHub users with no JIRA email match should form their own 'Identity' object, listing only their GitHub account details."
  - "  5. JIRA users not matched to any GitHub user should also form their own 'Identity' object, listing only their JIRA account details."
  - "Ensure each 'Identity' object is unique. Do not create duplicate 'Identity' entries for the same resolved individual."
  - "Populate the 'all_emails' list with all distinct, valid email addresses associated with the resolved identity."
  - "Populate the 'accounts' list with 'AccountInfo' objects detailing the platform, login, and email for each linked source account."
  - "You MUST output your response STRICTLY as a valid JSON object conforming to the 'IdentityList' Pydantic model, containing a list of 'Identity' objects."
  - "Do not perform any new database queries. Operate only on the data provided in the 'SQLResults' input."
