"""
Aggregates and annotates GitHub commit diffs per committer into a unified table.

Description
-----------
Generates the COMMITTER_DIFFS table by processing raw GitHub diff data from the GITHUB_DIFFS source table. Groups diffs by committer, combines multiple diffs into a single formatted string, and records metadata and the committer's earliest code change.

    1. Filters out null or empty CODE_TEXT and null COMMITTER_ID entries.
    2. Orders commit diffs by descending COMMIT_TIMESTAMP (most recent first).
    3. Aggregates commit diffs into a single block until character length cap is reached.
    4. Captures how many file diffs each committer contributed and total character length.
    5. Extracts first diff content based on earliest COMMIT_TIMESTAMP.
